\section{Experience}
\cventry{\yearabove{\shortmonthname[10]}{2022}--Present}{Data Scientist}{Yahoo Japan Corporation}{Osaka, Japan}{}{Responsible for the development of CVR (Conversion Rate) prediction models for the display ads, which is used for the automated bidding. Experienced data aggregation using Hive on a Hadoop cluster, development of machine learning models using Python (XGBoost, LightGBM), construction of DevOps and MLOps pipelines with Argo Workflows, Airflow, and Screwdriver.cd, and A/B testing in the production environment. All processes are performed on the AWS-like (such as S3) or GCP-like (such as Vertex AI) private cloud platform.}
\cventry{\yearabove{\shortmonthname[2]}{2017}--Present}{YouTuber}{}{}{}{
    Manage two YouTube channels, the \httplink[Gaming channel]{youtube.com/@zalgogame} with 16,100 subscribers / 7,063,000 total views and the \httplink[Music Cover channel]{youtube.com/@zalgosing} with 4,500 subscribers / 1,170,000 total views. \httplink[A speedrun video]{youtube.com/watch?v=_h3crP83iNk} has more than 1 million views. Also have a \httplink[virtual YouTuber channel]{youtube.com/@MonomousuYT} that is automated by a \emph{generative AI}, basically written in Python and uses the OpenAI API and the Azure Kubernetes Service.

\cventry{\dates[04.2020-09.2022]}{Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (DC1)}{Japan Society for the Promotion of Science}{Tokyo, Japan}{}{
Awarded to excellent PhD students with a selection ration of 20\%, this fellowship allows the fellows to focus on a freely chosen research topic based on their innovative ideas.\newline{}
\textbf{Research subject}: Development, theoretical analysis, and implementation of multiobjective optimization algorithms, particularly first-order methods, i.e., methods that use only the first-order derivatives of the objective functions. They are useful in machine learning, statistics, signal and image processing.}
\cventry{\dates[09.2020-09.2020]}{Software Engineering Internship}{VOYAGE Group Inc.}{Tokyo, Japan}{}{Developed a coding test tool in a four-person engineering team to improve efficiency in HR. Communicated with the HR staff and asked about their recruiting problems. Designed the prototype with Miro. Implemented authentication by Google account, uploading source codes, and grading each submission, using Vue.js and Firebase.}
\cventry{\dates[08.2020-09.2020]}{Data Scientist Internship}{Yahoo Japan Corporation}{Osaka, Japan}{}{
Estimated heterogeneous treatment effect on earnings of Yahoo! Japan Auction of a recommendation system by using Machine Learning with Python on Jupyter Notebook. Analyzed seven days of preprocessed traffic data of Yahoo! Japan Auction, including the click data of the recommendation banner, in Pandas DataFrame. Implemented X-Learner, a kind of algorithm called ``meta-learner,'' which estimates CATE (Conditional Average Treatment Effect) using any machine learning estimator. Used LightGBM and linear regression as the estimator of X-Learner. Prevented leakage through correlation analysis. Verified if the recommendation system impacts the earnings via Student's t-test and Cohen's d effect size. Note that such estamates of the treatment effect is useful when it is difficult to conduct A/B testing.

\cventry{\dates[08.2020-08.2020]}{Software Engineering Internship}{Cookpad Japan Inc.}{Tokyo, Japan}{}{
Built a new Ruby on Rails web application from scratch. It enables users to record and rate recipes they have used. Using the Lean Startup Methodology, developed the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that satisfies the value hypothesis and utilized a feedback loop through user testing. Presented a prototype of the product by using Figma. Implemented functions of recording recipes with title, memo, image, and rating, editing and destroying them, showing them in a grid view, and sorting them by rating and date, using Ruby on Rails, Docker, Boostrap.

\cventry{\dates[02.2019-03.2020]}{Data Scientist Internship}{HACARUS Inc.}{Kyoto, Japan}{}{
    Designed and developed some machine learning models for the manufacturing and agricultural industry, mainly through analyzing a small number of image datasets, typically using Python. In particular, developed models for surface defect detection through various techniques, including dictionary learning and fused lasso and hyperspectral image segmentation via online dictionary learning and typical classification algorithms (e.g., support vector machine, random forest). Surveyed scientific papers and implemented algorithms from them, using some machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn), image processing libraries (e.g., open-cv, scikit-image), data visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn), and notebooks environments (e.g., Jupyter).\newline{}
    \textbf{Other minor engagements included}: Added some new algorithms (e.g., alternating direction methods of multipliers for the generalized lasso, matching pursuit for sparse coding) to the open-source library ``\httplink[spm-image]{github.com/hacarus/spm-image},'' a scikit-learn compatible library of sparse modelling and compressive sensing. Implemented batch-OMP, an improved version of the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, to contribute to the research project from NEDO (the New Energy and Development Organization), the Japanese largest governmental R\&D organization. Developed front-end of an in-house web application that generates an interactive visualization of image datasets' quality, using flask, pandas, and bokeh.
